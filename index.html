    <h2>Cheeseburger Soup Recipe</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ground Beef: </strong> Lean ground beef is best for cheeseburger soup. You can use a higher-fat
            blend
            like 80/20, but
            be sure to drain off all the excess grease to avoid an oily finish.</li>
        <li><strong>Flour and butter: </strong> These ingredients come together to create a roux, which is commonly used
            to thicken
            sauces.</li>
        <li><strong>Vegatables:</strong> The aromatic combination of onions, carrots and celery gives the soup depth and
            adds a burst of
            color.</li>
        <li><strong>Potatoes:</strong> Use your favorite type of potato in cheeseburger soup. You can even use frozen
            cubed hash brown
            potatoes!</li>
        <li><strong>Chicken broth and milk:</strong> The combination of savory chicken broth and creamy milk gives this
            soup some serious
            cheeseburger vibes. For a richer flavor, use half-and-half.</li>
        <li><strong>Velveeta:</strong> We love Velveeta cheese recipes! This processed cheese gives the soup a thick
            texture and an
            extra-cheesy finish.</li>
        <li><strong>Sour Cream:</strong> This tangy ingredient thickens the soup and adds a light acidity to balance all
            the rich
            flavors.</li>
    </ul>
